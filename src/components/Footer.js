        <p>art_AI_fact re-interprets well known artists digital traces gathered from our vast  visual and textual networked culture.  </p>
 
        <p>art_AI_fact allows hybrid 'synths' to continue making art and reinventing their story. </p>
        <p>art_AI_fact generates the artist own pseudo account of imagined continuity including a name for their 'new' piece, mixing factual and fictional biographical information about their style, opinions about their work by other artists, curators and art historians. </p>
        <p>art_AI_fact is a speculative semi-deterministic story/history machine about the artist's traces, influences and their main creative features favored by institutional historization, art markets and cognitive capitalism. All images and texts are unique and generated in real-time as speculative digital objects.</p>
        <p>art_AI_fact problematizes simlistic notions of history and cultural productions, foregrounding the amplifying effects of socio-cultural forces such as economic power, hegemonic ideology and esthetics, dominant epistemologies, artistic cannons, data flows and their embodiment in AI models.</p>
        <p>art_AI_fact is not an account of the artists lives and work. It is an attempt of weaving  cultural complexities manifested in the the mediation of commodified narratives and cultural artifacts.</p>
        <p>art_AI_fact is a speculative tool for reflexion, not a replacement for human creativity; creative tools expands human intelligence; complex cognition is a distributed process between bodies, contexts, situated actions, hybrid agents and systems, patterns and metapatters, translations and multiple temporalities...
        For art_AI_fact, the (AI) model is the message. </p>

            <Card.Text>
 <p> A product of human workmanship, especially an object of cultural or historical interest.</p>
<p>Something viewed as a product of human conception or agency rather than an inherent element.</p>
<p>A phenomenon or feature not originally present or expected and caused by an interfering external agent, action, or process, as an unwanted feature or effect.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence is a tool for reflexion, not a replacement for human creativity; creative tools expands human intelligence; complex cognition is a distributed process between bodies, contexts, situated actions, hybrid agents and systems, patterns and metapatters, translations and multiple temporalities... 
    creativity, intelligence, human nature and art are social constructs...artifacts of culture and history.</p>
  
<p>Inspired by the ongoing work, practices and research of artists, curators and rule breakers; may this project honor you...</p>
